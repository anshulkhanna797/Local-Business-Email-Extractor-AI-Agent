This project is an AI-powered automation workflow built using n8n that helps collect business emails from Google Maps automatically.

How It Works

User enters a search query (e.g. “interior designer Bangalore”).

The agent searches Google Maps for local businesses.

It extracts business websites from the results.

Visits each website and finds email addresses using AI and regex.

Saves all emails in a structured list (Google Sheet / CSV).
